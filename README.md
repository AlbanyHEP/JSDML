# JSDML
The Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Machine Learning Toolbox

(with some code borrowed from Greg Ver Steeg's NPEET package (https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET))

The JSDML is a python package that implements a neural network using Keras/Tensorflow for feature selection and also calculates MI or the JSD between features and class labels using methods developed by Kraskov (https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305641.pdf) and modified code from NPEET (https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET).

Documentation is provided at https://github.com/AlbanyHEP/JSDML/blob/master/JSDML_Documentation.pdf.  For users who wish to get started quickly without wading through the main documentation will find a quick start guide and examples in (https://github.com/AlbanyHEP/JSDML/tree/master/Quick_Start_Guide).
